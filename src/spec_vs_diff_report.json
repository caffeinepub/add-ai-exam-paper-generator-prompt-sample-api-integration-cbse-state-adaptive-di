  "summary": "AppShell now passes the existing in-app navigation handler (setCurrentPage) into StudentDashboardPage, and StudentDashboardPage wires quick-action handlers intended to navigate to 'tutor' and 'exam-generator' via that callback. Click handling is present; keyboard accessibility support is partially evident but not fully verifiable from the truncated diff.",

      "id": "REQ-16",
      "requirement": "Quick-action cards remain visually clickable and are keyboard-accessible (e.g., support Enter/Space activation) or are implemented with accessible interactive elements.",
      "reason": "The diff shows an onKeyDown handler that listens for Enter/Space, but in the visible snippet the clickable Card itself is not shown as focusable (e.g., via tabIndex=0) nor given an explicit interactive role (e.g., role=\"button\"). Without a focusable/interactive element, keyboard users may not be able to reach the card to trigger the key handler. The file is truncated, so this may exist outside the shown section, but it is not evidenced in the provided diff.",
